# 🏥 Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan Team Project**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Disease Prediction System is a Machine Learning-based application that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.

The system analyzes symptom data using trained classification models and provides disease predictions with evaluation metrics.
