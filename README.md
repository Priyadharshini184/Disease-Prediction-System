# 🏥 Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan Team Project**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Disease Prediction System is a Machine Learning-based application that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.

The system analyzes symptom data using trained classification models and provides disease predictions with evaluation metrics.

## 🎯 Objective

To build an intelligent healthcare assistance system that can:
- Accept symptoms as input
- Process and encode symptom data
- Predict possible diseases
- Evaluate model performance

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- HTML / CSS

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
